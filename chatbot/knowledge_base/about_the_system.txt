This document provides information about the car park system.

The primary goal of the system is to provide real-time and historical data about car park availability in Birmingham.

Data is stored in two main systems:
1. A real-time HBase table for the absolute latest data.
2. A historical Hive table for analytical queries.

The system uses a chatbot interface to allow users to query this data using natural language.
The chatbot is powered by an OpenAI model and a set of custom tools for data retrieval.
The main identifier for any car park is its `system_code_number`.
